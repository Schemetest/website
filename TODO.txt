Set up proper licencing.

https://github.com/srfi-explorations/srfi-test is a repo I started a
while back to collect tests for as many SRFIs as we can in one place.
The tests in that repo use the SRFI 64 test definition primitives. Shiro
and Alex graciously donates many of their excellent tests under the MIT
License so the licensing situation for the repo can be as simple as the
situation with the SRFI documents themselves. Marc Feeley also donated
any tests in Gambit and is converting them piecemeal to SRFI 64.

The ultimate idea would be that the repo can have the test suites in a
format that Scheme implementations can simply copy those files verbatim
into their source trees. Doing whatever it takes to get them into a form
that implementors find agreeable. (include "...") in (define-library)
does wonders to enable portable .scm files. I haven't yet had the energy
to pursue this since there are so many things to do, but it'd be awesome
if you do. Aggregating the tests already uncovered a bunch of bugs; I
expect doing it more would uncover more and save everyone time in the
long run.

We have Docker containers for 45 Scheme implementations at
<https://hub.docker.com/u/schemers>, including a container build from
git master for many of the actively developed Schemes. I can give ssh
access to people I know from the lists to a Linux server with Docker
pre-configured.
